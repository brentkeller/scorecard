Scorecard app

# Info

Node version: 14.17.0

# Ideas

Create a generic Game object that can be the base for any game
GameContext is also generic, allows providing a React Context for a given game, most likely provided within a shell for that game type?

Allow creating a new game with the same settings as another game but without the scores

Replace react-spring animations with framer motion?
